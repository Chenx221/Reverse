Hello dear crackers,
  taking a break from the daily routine,i coded this crackme.This one should be solvable with a bit of bruteforce.Well,this is not the only way,but finding the key by thinking is a bit difficult but not impossible,of course.The key is deliberately small,as the purpose here is just to let you know of a possible way of encryption using a somehow "weird" way.I really don't know if someone has thought of this before,personally i've not seen it somewhere,but as i had this idea,i thought it would be nice to share with other crackers.
  If you bruteforce,be sure to understand what is going on and explain it in your tutorial(if you write one).I would rate it about 1-2/10 personally.Just take a look at this...

Kind Regards,
